## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Parse large, unstructured technical PDF manuals
- Infer document structure (chapters, sections, tables) programmatically
- Chunk content intelligently for RAG use cases
- Enable secure ingestion into vector databases
- Support downstream LLM-based question answering

### ✅ What IS stored here
- Parsing logic
- Chunking strategies
- Structural inference rules

All real documents are in **secure storage**
